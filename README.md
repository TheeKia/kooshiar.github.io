# Kooshiar - [Front-End Competition](https://github.com/kooshiar/competitions)

Build a Pinterest style web page that displays information from the API endpoint.

## About My Code...

This project could be done in many ways (REACT, Next.Js), but since It's a small one, I choose HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript.

Since opinions on user interface can vary and The **design goals are unknown**.
I focused **mainly on logic** and **adding more features**

### Website features

#### Exrta Score

- [x] **Infinite-scroll**
- [x] **Mobile responsive**: It's been designed to work on any device and browser.
- [x] **Client-side search**

#### More features

- **Similar Products**: I've tried to detect the **type**, **color**, **material** and **style** of the product as soon as it loads and then used the data to find similar ones to show when user clicks on the product.
- **Save section**: Each product has a save button that can be then accessed from **saved section** (On top menu)
  - Although it's totally functional but since there is no back-end to save the data, It will be deleted if you clear the browser data.
- **Dark Theme**: The theme default is _light_, but you can change it to _dark_ via the button on the header.
  - The theme preference is saved on the **local storage** (Like saved products).

### More information

I had some ideas about categorizing the saved products but I think the point of this challenge is to determine the skill level of the contestants. And doing so is required no new skill set. But I will do **whatever it takes** to join your team. so please let me know if I had to add more features or change the design.
